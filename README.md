# HackKU2019 Socialyzer
##Notes
#### First, we chose not to use the built in explicit check that comes witb Google Cloud Vision in order to use our own key words. Next, we decide the presence of a bad term in a section was more important than repetition of it so we do not check for it.
### Socialyzer - while a breathalyzer is used to check if it is safe for somebody to drive by their breath, Socialyzer checks if it is safe fore somebody to be employed based off of their social media content. The purpose of the project is to allow workplaces to more easily analyze a potential employee's social media accounts for things that would deem them unfit for the job. This is important for society as a whole because would you want a teacher you can't trust to be responsible with your children?
